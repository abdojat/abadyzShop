# Runtime Error Fix: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')"

## Problem
The application was frequently encountering runtime errors where it tried to access `error.response.data.message` when `error.response` or `error.response.data` was undefined. This typically happens when:

- Network requests fail
- API server is unreachable
- Network timeouts occur
- CORS issues prevent proper error responses

## Root Cause
The error handling in Redux action creators was unsafely accessing nested properties:
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
catch (error) {
    dispatch({
        type: SOME_FAIL,
        payload: error.response.data.message // ❌ Could be undefined
    });
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Safe Error Handler Utility (`src/utils/errorHandler.js`)
- **Function**: `getErrorMessage(error)` - Safely extracts error messages
- **Features**:
  - Handles various error response formats
  - Provides fallback messages for network errors
  - Prevents runtime crashes from undefined property access

### 2. Updated All Action Files
Fixed error handling in:
- ✅ `src/actions/productActions.js`
- ✅ `src/actions/authActions.js` 
- ✅ `src/actions/cartActions.js`
- ✅ `src/actions/orderActions.js`
- ✅ `src/actions/userActions.js`

### 3. Safe Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// SAFE CODE:
import { getErrorMessage } from '../utils/errorHandler';

catch (error) {
    dispatch({
        type: SOME_FAIL,
        payload: getErrorMessage(error) // ✅ Always returns a string
    });
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Runtime Crashes**: Application won't break when API calls fail
2. **Better User Experience**: Users see meaningful error messages instead of crashes
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: All action creators now handle errors the same way
4. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized error handling reduces code duplication

## Error Types Handled

- Network connectivity issues
- API server downtime
- Malformed API responses
- Timeout errors
- Authentication failures
- CORS issues
- Unexpected error formats

## Testing Status
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ Development server starts without errors
✅ All ESLint warnings addressed (except minor unused variables)

The application should no longer crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors when API calls fail.

## Additional Fix (2025-09-20)

- Problem: The login page was sometimes not accessible because stale authentication state was being restored from Redux Persist. This led the app to think the user was authenticated when they were not, resulting in navigation away from `/login`.
- Fix: Stopped persisting the `auth` slice in `src/store.js` (whitelist now only includes `cart`). This ensures the app doesn't restore stale `isAuthenticated` state on page load.
