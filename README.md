Quick start

1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or an alternative package manager

2. Clone and install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/abdojat/abadyzShop.git
cd client
npm install
```

3. Environment

Copy the environment example (if present) and set the required public environment variables. At minimum populate the API base URL and public payment keys.

Create a `.env` file at the project root (same level as package.json) with the following variables:

```properties
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-host.example.com
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-host.example.com/api/v1
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PK=pk_test_...
REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=sb
```

Notes
- Do not commit secret keys or server-side credentials to the repository. The `.env` file is only for public/ client-side keys (publishable Stripe keys, public analytics IDs).
- When running locally the app expects a compatible backend API implementing the routes used in `src/api/index.js`.

4. Development

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```powershell
npm start
```

The app will open at http://localhost:3000 by default.

5. Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
```

The production-ready build will be written to the `build/` folder and can be served by a static file server or deployed to any static hosting provider.

API and backend

This client communicates with a REST API. The client code expects an API base URL set via `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` and uses endpoints such as:

- POST /login, /register
- GET /me, /logout
- GET /products, GET /product/:id
- POST /order/new, GET /orders/me, GET /order/:id
- Admin endpoints under /admin/*

The project's default `.env` contains an example pointing to https://abadyzshopapi.onrender.com. Replace with your own backend URL when deploying.

Configuration and performance

- `src/config/performance.js` initializes lightweight monitoring hooks used in development and production.
- The app registers a service worker in production for offline caching and faster subsequent loads.

Testing

Unit/integration tests use the React Testing Library. Run tests with:

```powershell
npm test
```

Contributing

Contributions are welcome. When contributing, follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
- Keep changes small and focused. Include tests for new behaviors when applicable.

Security

- Never commit private keys, passwords, or server-side secrets.
- The client stores and uses only public, publishable keys for payment providers. Sensitive operations and secrets must be handled server-side.
